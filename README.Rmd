Repo to explore ways of maintaining reproducible research.

This repo will be used to explore various methods of sharing code, with an aim of encouraging reproducible research.

I will look at using tools/software such as Git and Docker.


## Docker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aboland/ReproducibleResearch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aboland/ReproducibleResearch)

Docker provides a way to create of a virtual environment. These environments built and stored as Docker images. The images can be easily shared and run by anybody who has Docker installed.
